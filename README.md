## machine learning sensor project

## Problem Statement
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict the quality of semiconductor wafers as either "Good" or "Bad" based on sensor readings collected during the fabrication process.

Details
Inputs (Features):
The dataset consists of 590 sensor readings (Sensor-1, Sensor-2, ..., Sensor-590) for each wafer. These readings capture various environmental and process parameters during the wafer's fabrication.

Output (Target):
The target variable is labeled as "Good/Bad", where:

1 indicates a "Good" wafer
-1 indicates a "Bad" wafer
Goal
The goal is to build a classification model that can accurately predict whether a wafer is good or bad based on the sensor readings. This prediction can help in:
✅ Early detection of defective wafers
✅ Improving yield efficiency
✅ Reducing waste in semiconductor manufacturing

Machine Learning Task
Type: Supervised Learning (Classification)
Model: Binary Classification Model
