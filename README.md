## machine learning sensor project

## In this project, we develop a Machine Learning (ML) model to detect faults in sensor data. Sensors are widely used in industries, healthcare, and IoT systems, but they can fail due to various reasons such as wear and tear, environmental conditions, or calibration issues. This project aims to identify faulty sensors early, ensuring smooth operations and preventing system failures.
